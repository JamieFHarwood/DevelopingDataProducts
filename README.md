This Repo contains the files required for the peer assessed assignment element of the Developing Data Products module of the Coursera Data Scientist Specialization.

The shiny files are in the shinyApp folder and this includes the required server.R and Ui.R.  Note that the Rdata files contain pregenerated data required by the application in order to perform efficient classification using a random forest generated model.

To see how this data was generated I have included the TextMiningPrep.R file that creates them as well as the original source data under courses/ so this should all be reproducible from scratch.

This repository also contains the code for the Rpres part of the assignment in the Rpres folder.

Note that the presentation is hosted on RPubs **NOT** here on github. Here is the url
